# Back Matter

## Glossary

- **annotated tag** — a tag that is itself an object: tagger, date, message, hashed and chained; the form for every named moment other parties consume.
- **append-only covenant** — published history only appends; private history reshapes freely; never confuse the two.
- **archive tag** — an annotated tag under a reserved namespace preserving a dead branch's story (with its reason) after the branch is deleted.
- **author / committer** — who created a change versus who entered it into this history; each carries its own date, and rebases move only the committer's.
- **bisect run** — binary search over history conducted unattended by a predicate command; exit 0 good, 1–127 bad, 125 skip.
- **bundle** — a single file carrying real history, accepted by clone and fetch as a remote; the repository's transport for environments no forge reaches.
- **cherry-pick** — applying an existing commit's change elsewhere as a new commit (new hash); a copy with citation (`-x`), never a move.
- **commit template** — a message scaffold installed via `commit.template`; the blank that asks the right questions before any gate judges the answers.
- **content addressing** — every object named by the hash of its content; identical content bears identical names everywhere.
- **detached HEAD** — standing on a commit with no branch underneath; ordinary for reads and probes, and named before any work is committed there.
- **fast-forward** — a merge that merely advances the branch pointer, minting no integration entry; `--no-ff` records the moment instead.
- **first-parent** — walking only an integration branch's own spine, treating each merged branch as one step; bisection and log at merge altitude.
- **five answers** — what was asked, what was done, what was not, how verified, how undone: the handoff contract a proposal's description owes.
- **hook** — a script the repository runs at a threshold, empowered to refuse; client hooks are self-discipline, server hooks are authority.
- **idempotency trailer** — the `Ledger-Op:` message trailer joining a commit to the estate operation that produced it.
- **index (staging area)** — the assembly bench for the next entry; snapshots content at `add` time, accepts patches, previewed by `diff --staged`.
- **lease** — `--force-with-lease`: compare-and-swap on a ref, refusing if the remote moved past your last knowledge; only as fresh as your last fetch.
- **no-run marking** — a listing executed by the author but excluded from the gate's per-book execution budget; fragments, by contrast, never run.
- **non-fast-forward refusal** — the remote's report that it holds work you lack; answered by fetch and integration, never by force.
- **notes** — mutable annotations attached beside commits after the fact; afterknowledge in the append-only system's own grammar.
- **pathspec** — staging and querying by explicit path or pattern; the precision instrument that keeps two truths out of one commit.
- **pickaxe (`-S`)** — history filtered to commits where a string's occurrence count changed; the birth-and-death query for any content.
- **porcelain / plumbing** — git's own names for its human-facing and machine-facing layers; machine formats (`--porcelain`, `--format`) are the parseable contract.
- **pull request** — a protocol, not a product: a branch, a base, and a proposal document with enough context to judge integration.
- **reflog** — the private, expiring journal of every place each ref has pointed; the black-box recorder for private history's accidents.
- **replayable hunt** — a bisection resumed across sessions via `bisect log` and `bisect replay`; the hunt's state as two durable artifacts.
- **request-pull** — git's original proposal generator: base, fetch location, endpoint, shortlog, diffstat — the skeleton every forge PR decorates.
- **rerere** — recorded conflict resolutions replayed on recurrence; automation of a judgment that must have been recorded the first time.
- **shallow clone** — history truncated at a depth; correct for read-only consumers, wrong wherever archaeology, bisection, or inheritance briefings run.
- **sparse checkout** — a worktree scoped to a subtree; least-privilege for the working surface while full history remains beneath.
- **squash** — collapsing a branch's entries into one at integration; linear history purchased with commit-level truths.
- **stacked proposals** — dependent tasks shipped as a chain of PRs, each reviewing its own increment; carried through rebases by `--update-refs`.
- **tombstone** — the recorded reason a thing ended, left where its absence will be noticed.
- **trailer** — a `Key: value` line at a message's end; the commit's machine-parseable provenance block.
- **unprotected zone** — uncommitted changes: outside every net; kept narrow by commit cadence, entered only with `diff` read and dry runs rehearsed.
- **worktree** — an additional working tree and checked-out branch over one shared object store; the seat-per-task instrument of fleet parallelism.

## Feature floors

The git features this book leans on beyond the ancient core, with the
versions that introduced them, in one place: `git worktree` 2.5 (2015) ·
`git tag --format` 2.6 · `core.hooksPath` 2.9 (2016) · `--porcelain=v2`
status 2.11 · `git branch --format` 2.13 · `%(trailers:key=…,valueonly)`
in `git log --format` 2.22 (2019) · `restore`/`switch` 2.23 ·
`sparse-checkout` command 2.25 · `git init -b` / `--initial-branch` 2.28
(2020) · `git maintenance` and `bisect --first-parent` 2.29 · SSH commit/tag
signing 2.34 · `rebase --update-refs` 2.38. One floor needs its reason stated,
because both its flags predate it by years: `git log -L` *with* `--no-patch`
(`-s`) requires git 2.42. `-L` and `-s` each existed long before, and the
combined command runs on older git — but until 2.42 `-s` did not clear the
line-log's own diff output, so only from 2.42 does the pairing actually
suppress the patch and leave the bare commit line the text relies on (git
2.42 release notes: the `-s` option of the diff family was corrected to clear
the formatting options given before it). Every floor is comfortably below any
currently maintained distribution's git; inherited machines check with one
`git --version`, and the techniques degrade gracefully (older spellings —
`checkout` for `restore`, manual stack rebasing for `--update-refs`,
`interpret-trailers --parse` for the trailer placeholder, `init` then
`symbolic-ref HEAD` for `init -b` — are noted where the text teaches the
modern form).

## A note on measured outputs

Outputs printed in this book's listings are real transcripts from the
authoring machine (Gentoo Linux, kernel 6.18.31-gentoo-dist), captured
2026-08-28 in scratch repositories under the publisher gate's environment.
Hashes shown are those runs' real hashes and will differ on re-execution
(commit objects digest their dates); refusal messages, statuses, and
behaviors are the reproducible claims. Listings using `git log -L` with
`--no-patch` require git 2.42 or later.
